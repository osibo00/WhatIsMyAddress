# Unit 03 Mid-Unit Assessment

I used the Nexus 5X API 25 emulator.
I was familiar with pretty much all of what we had to do for this assessment as I had done all of it for my Buzzfeed quiz homework. 
I had some issues with git in the very beginning as I had encountered an error of sorts that I had not previously not encountered before. 
Also my itemview layout needed a slight tweek to have better visibility on the emulator screen.
